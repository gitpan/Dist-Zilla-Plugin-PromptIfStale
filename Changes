Revision history for Dist-Zilla-Plugin-PromptIfStale

0.024     2014-07-23 20:13:17Z
          - switch from using JSON to JSON::MaybeXS
          - avoid reporting core (non-duallifed) modules as being stale, since
            they cannot be updated without updating perl itself

0.023     2014-05-15 20:38:19Z
          - 'dzil stale' now respects all plugins' skip options
          - improved debug logging
          - cache more data for efficiency when multiple plugins, options are
            used at once
          - new "check_authordeps" option

0.022     2014-04-19 08:28:04Z
          - "dzil stale" now falls back even harder to parsing authordeps out
            of dist.ini when performing the build blew up (such as due to an
            unsatisfied develop prereq)
          - new sister plugin, [EnsureNotStale], which aborts instead of
            prompting (this is for you, Getty - sorry it's too late)

0.021     2014-03-23 05:40:38Z
          - 'dzil stale' properly falls back to fetching authordeps when a
            plugin is not at the required version

0.020     2014-03-01 06:49:02Z
          - fix "dzil stale --all" when no [PromptIfStale] plugins are
            configured for the distribution
          - dzil stale now respects the --verbose flag
          - dzil stale now does the equivalent of 'dzil authordeps' if some
            plugins are missing, rather than dying -- you can now use 'dzil
            stale' as your one stop shop for ensuring all requirements are
            fulfilled

0.019     2014-02-28 04:34:49Z
          - fix occasional test failures on win32 due to varying directory
            separators in filenames

0.018     2014-02-23 23:29:22Z
          - new --all option for "dzil stale"

0.017     2014-02-12 05:20:07Z
          - fix uninitialized warning when 02packages.details.txt cannot be
            downloaded

0.016     2014-02-09 03:41:16Z
          - new "dzil stale" command

0.015     2013-12-10 23:38:52Z, a.k.a. "The Getty Release"
          - new 'fatal' option, to avoid prompting
          - new 'index_base_url' option, for using different CPAN indexes

0.014     2013-11-29 05:53:17Z
          - new 'skip' option

0.013     2013-11-15 04:19:33Z
          - more diagnostics printed in failing tests

0.012     2013-11-10 19:27:11Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - no longer loading each module being checked in order to get its
            $VERSION
          - fix logic for choosing when to pull down a copy of
            02packages.details.txt (now only doing so when otherwise we would
            make six or more HTTP hits to PAUSE)
          - more diagnostics printed in failing tests

0.011     2013-11-10 01:54:55Z
          - honour check_all_prereqs setting at release time (previously
            behaviour was always as if it was on); thanks David Golden!

0.010     2013-11-03 20:22:01Z (TRIAL RELEASE)
          - more diagnostics printed in failing tests

0.009     2013-11-02 21:15:16Z
          - work around issues with EUMM-bundled version.pm by properly
            fudging a VERSION during testing (affected perls before 5.13.9)

0.008     2013-10-11 01:47:09Z
          - now also checks the configure and build prerequisites

0.007     2013-10-02 03:58:16Z
          - when killing a build after being prompted, include a line that can
            be copy-pasted to install all the missing modules via cpanm
          - speed up index querying when checking for 6 or more modules at
            once by pulling down a copy of 02packages.details.txt.gz

0.006     2013-09-24 04:36:43Z
          - diagnostic message added before checks begin, so the user isn't
            wondering why the build/release appears to hang (querying the
            index can take a little bit of time if there are a lot of modules
            to check)

0.005     2013-09-16 00:05:07Z
          - now only prompting once (per phase) for all discrepancies found
          - no longer prompting for the same module twice, if there are
            multiple instances of the plugin running

0.004     2013-09-11 01:39:02Z
          - New "check_all_prereqs" option
          - warnings tests bypassed during installation

0.003     2013-09-05 07:45:52Z
          - gracefully handle checking for a module that is not installed
          - support setting both the check_all_plugins and module configs at
            once

0.002     2013-08-13 01:04:29Z
          - fix documentation that referred to an option by the wrong name
          - inverted prompt, from "abort build?" to "continue anyway?" (with
            the default remaining as aborting the build/not continuing)
          - version checks are bypassed for modules provided by the dist being
            built

0.001     2013-08-12 04:20:18Z
          - Initial release.
